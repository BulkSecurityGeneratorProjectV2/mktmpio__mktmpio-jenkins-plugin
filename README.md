# Coming Soon!

The mktmpio Jenkins Plugin will allow you to use
[mktmpio](https://mktmp.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=jenkins)
to provision a temporary DB server for use by your tests that gets
shutdown once the Jenkins job finishes. Perfect for ensuring your tests
operate on a clean slate, every time.
